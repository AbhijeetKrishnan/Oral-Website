## Title: A Computational Model of Visual Narrative Comprehension
> - **Research Theme:** we propose a computational model for the analysis of multi-modal narratives based on two datasets of western comics (Comics from Iyyer et al. 2017) and Japanese manga(Manga109 from 2017).
> - **Findings:** 
> <ol>
> <li>A Computational Model of Comprehension in Manga Style Visual Narratives--Study Features That Influences Understanding.</li>
> <li>Panel Transitions for Genre Analysis in Visual Narratives--Inter-panel Relations and Content.</li>
> <li>Style Transfer for Multi-Modal Narratives--Visual Representations and Intra-panel Relations.</li>
> <li>Extendable Comic Generator--Applying Comic Theories to Comics Generation.</li>
> </ol>
> - **Proposed Work:**
>Our target comprehension model will be developed based on Scene Perception & Event Comprehension theory (SPECT) since it formalized the cognitive process about visual narrative comprehension. We are going to adjust the SPECT by combining the scene semantic representations of comic panels and a modified hierarchical LSTM.

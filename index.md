## Research Theme

Competitive games admit a wide variety of player strategies and emergent, domain-specific concepts that are not obvious
from an examination of their rules. Expert agents trained on these games demonstrate many useful strategies, but these
are difficult for human players to understand and adopt. Algorithmically revealing these strategies could help players
develop a better model for making decisions that lead to victories. I propose to investigate approaches to the problem
of interpretable strategy synthesis i.e., the problem of finding algorithmic approaches to learning useful strategies
for games that can be understood and applied by a human player. This work formalizes the interpretable strategy
synthesis problem and applies Inductive Logic Programming to solve it for the game of chess. My hypothesis is that
different game domains will require domain-specific strategy representations in order to improve their in-game
effectiveness and interpretability for a human player.

## Proposed Work

- Solve the interpretable strategy synthesis problem for MicroRTS using a sequence model and/or an ASP-based approach.
- Investigate the factors affecting the perceived interpretability of a strategy model for the domain of MicroRTS.

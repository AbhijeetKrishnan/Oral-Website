# Strategy Modeling and Synthesis in Games for Player Training

## Research Theme

We propose a computational model of a game strategy using first-order logic. We present a machine
learning technique to learn this model from playtraces. Finally, we present an evaluation of the learned model in improving
player skill.


## Findings

1. Towards Action Model Learning for Player Modeling.
2. Towards the Automatic Synthesis of Interpretable Chess Tactics.

## Proposed Work

Develop metrics to measure the efficacy of a strategy model for a particular purpose; compare various strategy models
across different domains (chess, MicroRTS, Atari) using these metrics; investigate various learning methods for learning
said strategy models
